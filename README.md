* *Bibliography for the python project*

I consulted this [stackoverflow page question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46380075/pandas-select-n-middle-rows) for details on how to chunk data frames.

Stackoverflow, the programmers saviour assisted me with how to break down my data into days, hours, minutes and seconds. I looked at [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/775049/how-do-i-convert-seconds-to-hours-minutes-and-seconds). I also looked at the [geeksforgeeks blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-seconds-into-days-hours-minutes-and-seconds/)
